  transcription-guidelines: "In general this meant deciding between diplomatic transcription\
    \ (i.e. sticking to what it says on the page) and gently modernized features (i.e.\
    \ reinterpreting medieval signs into modern equivalents) with a view to specific\
    \ categories. Read on for a summary of the rules and the respective rationale\
    \ behind them.\nSUMMARY\nPUNCTUATION\n\n    Modern: medieval punctuation is transcribed\
    \ with modern equivalents; punctus elevatus transcribed as semicolon\n\nCAPITALIZATION\n\
    \n    Diplomatic: Original capitalization retained\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n    Diplomatic\
    \ where possible: Retain abbreviations and render glyphs as opposed to expanded\
    \ versions where possible\n    \"*\" where original character isn't served: OCRopus\
    \ (at the point in time of transcription) could not handle some of the medieval\
    \ glyphs, even where a Unicode version was present. Abbreviations not in OCRopus\
    \ are uniformly transcribed as \"*\", in the case of a combined character (such\
    \ as a consonant with a macron) as the base character followed by \"*\" (e.g.\
    \ \"t*\"). The list of accepted characters in OCRopus can be found in this repository,\
    \ and downloaded and used as codec in the OCRopus training process.\n\nSPACING\n\
    \n    Diplomatic: Preserve manuscript spacing, i.e. give diplomatic transcription\n\
    \nNUMBERS\n\n    Diplomatic: retain original version of both Roman and Arabic\
    \ numerals'\n"

  transcription-guidelines: "As the data come from different projects, transcriptions\
    \ have been standardized to strengthen HTR models. We chose a graphemic transcription\
    \ method, following D. Stutzmann definitions (see bibliography), to have a sign\
    \ in the image corresponding to a sign in our text: all the abbreviations are\
    \ kept, and u/v or i/j are not distinguished. The spaces in the dataset are not\
    \ homogeneously represented, sometimes transcriptions reproduce the manuscript\
    \ spacing while others use lexical spaces. It must be stressed that spaces are\
    \ the most important source of error in medieval HTR models. Most of the transcription\
    \ follow the layout segmentation of the SegmOnto ontology (https://github.com/SegmOnto/examples),\
    \ separating the main column, margin, numbering, drop capital, etc. All the recommendations\
    \ are described in\n  the following document  : Ariane Pinche, Guide de transcription\
    \ pour les manuscrits du Xe au XVe si\xE8cle, 2022, \u27E8hal-03697382>, en ligne\
    \ : <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03697382>."
