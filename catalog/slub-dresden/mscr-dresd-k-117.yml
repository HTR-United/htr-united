 Twenty pages of Ground Truth from the "Hofdiarium des Kurfürsten Johann Georgs
 II. 1673" (SLUB Mscr.Dresd.K.117; https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134220291).
 The handwriting is a typical late 17th century Saxon kurrent
 ("Kanzleikurrent"), with occasional words written in bastarda or fraktur-like
 script.

 Transcription guidelines are oriented on the DTABF-M schema
 (https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/doku/basisformat/manuskript.html), but
 have been adapted as follows:


 - I and J majuscules are not distinguished

 - u and v are reproduced true to the original (e.g. vnd)

 - Long-s (ſ) and round-s (s) are distinguished

 - sz ligature is rendered as ß in Kurrent scripts and as sz (e.g. "Libusza")
 in Antiqua scripts

 - ij ligature is rendered as y

 - other ligatures, if they occur at all, are dissolved

 - r graphemes are rendered as r in their modern day form

 - an m with a nasal stroke was rendered as a simple mm

 - Where possible, abbreviation signs (Abbrechungszeichen) for the contemporary
 identification of abbreviations have been included as single letters and not
 marked separately. The subsequent punctuation mark (“.” or “:”) for further
 identification of the abbreviation has also been included (cf. also Capelli,
 1928, Lexicon abbreviaturarum I, p.X) 

 - Diacritics in u were not marked

 - In the case of uncertain capitalization, an approximation is sought via the
 letter size
