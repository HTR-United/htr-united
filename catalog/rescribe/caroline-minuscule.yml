transcription-guidelines: >
    In general this meant deciding between diplomatic transcription (i.e. sticking to what it says on the page) and gently modernized features (i.e. reinterpreting medieval signs into modern equivalents) with a view to specific categories. Read on for a summary of the rules and the respective rationale behind them.
    
    SUMMARY
    
    PUNCTUATION
    
        Modern: medieval punctuation is transcribed with modern equivalents; punctus elevatus transcribed as semicolon
    
    CAPITALIZATION
    
        Diplomatic: Original capitalization retained
    
    ABBREVIATIONS
    
        Diplomatic where possible: Retain abbreviations and render glyphs as opposed to expanded versions where possible
        "*" where original character isn't served: OCRopus (at the point in time of transcription) could not handle some of the medieval glyphs, even where a Unicode version was present. Abbreviations not in OCRopus are uniformly transcribed as "*", in the case of a combined character (such as a consonant with a macron) as the base character followed by "*" (e.g. "t*"). The list of accepted characters in OCRopus can be found in this repository, and downloaded and used as codec in the OCRopus training process.
    
    SPACING
    
        Diplomatic: Preserve manuscript spacing, i.e. give diplomatic transcription
    
    NUMBERS
    
        Diplomatic: retain original version of both Roman and Arabic numerals'
