transcription-guidelines: >-
  Transcription guidelines are oriented on the DTABF-M schema
  (https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/doku/basisformat/manuskript.html), but
  have been adapted as follows:


  - I and J majuscules are not distinguished

  - u and v are reproduced true to the original (e.g. vnd)

  - Long-s (ſ) and round-s (s) are distinguished

  - sz ligature is rendered as ß in Kurrent scripts and as sz (e.g. "Libusza")
  in Antiqua scripts

  - ij ligature is rendered as y

  - other ligatures, if they occur at all, are dissolved

  - r graphemes are rendered as r in their modern day form

  - an m with a nasal stroke was rendered as a simple m

  - Where possible, abbreviation signs (Abbrechungszeichen) for the contemporary
  identification of abbreviations have been included as single letters and not
  marked separately. The subsequent punctuation mark (“.” or “:”) for further
  identification of the abbreviation has also been included (cf. also Capelli,
  1928, Lexicon abbreviaturarum I, p.X) 

  - Diacritics in u were not marked

  - In the case of uncertain capitalization, an approximation is sought via the
  letter size
