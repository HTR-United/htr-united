transcription-guidelines: >-
 - Normalisation of «V» to «U» except in Latin inscriptions;

 - Preservation of the diacritical marks and punctuation as used by the Author
 except for the part in Greek;

 - Where the use of capital and small caps is not distinguished, it is
 transcribed according to the grammatical rules of the Italian language;

 - Tagging of uncertain words with the «unclear» tag;

 - Tagging of illegible words with three dots (...) and the «unclear» tag;

 - Use of the angle dash, instead of the hyphen, to divide words into syllables
 at the end of a line.

 Moreover due to some issues in the visualization of ancient symbols unicode,
 the Roman Denarius (U+10196) and the Roman Sestersius (U+10198) signs were
 transcribed using other symbols not used by the author from the Astronomical
 chart:

 Roman denarius sign ➛♀(U+2640 Female sign)

 Roman sestertius sign➛☿ (U+263F Mercury)

 In order to change them to the correct one during post-processing.
