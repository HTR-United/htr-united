description: >-
  The POPP datasets is a set of 3 datasets created within the POPP project
  (Project for the Oceration of the Paris Population Census) for the task of
  handwriting text recognition. These datasets have been published in
  "Recognition and information extraction in historical handwritten tables:
  toward understanding early 20th century Paris census" at DAS 2022.


  The 3 datasets are called “Generic dataset”, “Belleville”, and “Chaussée
  d’Antin” and contains lines made from the extracted rows of census tables from
  1926. Each table in the Paris census contains 30 rows, thus each page in these
  datasets corresponds to 30 lines.

  The text is transcribed as in the image (no correction of mispelling, no
  resolution of abbreviation).

  Since the lines are extracted from table rows, we defined 4 special characters
  to describe the structure of the text:
      ¤ : indicates an empty cell
      / : indicates the separation into columns
      ? : indicates that the content of the cell following this symbol is written above the regular baseline
      ! : indicates that the content of the cell following this symbol is written below the regular baseline
