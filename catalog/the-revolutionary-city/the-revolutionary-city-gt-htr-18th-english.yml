description: >-
 The Revolutionary City is a partnership between the American Philosophical
 Society, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Library Company of
 Philadelphia to digitize all manuscript material related to Philadelphia and
 the American Revolution (1763-1804). This dataset is a transcribed subset of
 the larger digitized corpus, provided in ALTO format with an intended use in
 training Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models. The material is
 overwhelmingly in English, though a few letters in French have been included.
 The material contains a mixture of correspondence and journals. The
 correspondence has been annotated to distinguish between the different parts
 of a letter (Salutation, Date and Address, Addressee, Address, Closing,
 Postscript). The transcriptions were produced by staff and interns at the
 American Philosophical Society. Each document was reviewed at least once by
 another transcriber. The corpus exhibits a wide variety of variation in hands,
 handwriting styles, paper quality and levels of damage. The corpus encompasses
 material from 1758 to 1805, but the majority of the documents fall between the
 years 1774 to 1783.

 Transcribers followed diplomatic transcription conventions. All abbreviations
 were transcribed as written. Superscript text was transcribed with a carat
 (^). Linebreaks were normalized to use a plain dash (-) regardless of the
 character used in the original document. The early modern glyph for "per" (â…Œ)
 was transcribed as "per." Other infrequently occurring glyphs were transcribed
 as written. Transcribers were advised to produce their best guesses for
 illegible text, but text that was illegible due to damage or other
 insurmountable problems was transcribed as [___]. Square brackets were used to
 indicate crossed-out text.
