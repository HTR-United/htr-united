description: >-
 Dataset for handwritten text recognition on medieval notarial charters written
 on parchment (1208-1499). The dataset is comprised of 100 digitized
 manuscripts (3,369 lines), carefully selected to represent the large variation
 that is present in the sources, encompassing at least 80 distinct hands and
 various document types (from sales and inventories to last wills and marriage
 contracts). Written primarily in Medieval Latin with fragments in Medieval
 Catalan, these manuscripts exhibit varying stages of preservation and degrees
 of deterioration.
