description: 'The Dataset is made up of 300 images, with their related ground truth
  stored in a XML file (pageXML format). Images come from three manuscripts selected
  among the collections of the BULAC Library (Paris). It covers a representative part
  of the handwritten production in Arabic Maghrebi scripts and includes an annotation
  of the layout (TextRegions, baselines and polygons) and the transcription of the
  main text. This dataset is the result of a collaborative transcription. All the
  participants are credited on the official deposit. With the support of the French
  Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, the Research Consortium Middle-East
  and Muslim Worlds (GIS MOMM), Calfa and the BULAC library.'
