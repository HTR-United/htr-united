  This dataset was designed for training machine learning models in the context
  of the [iForal project](https://iforal.hypotheses.org/), which focuses on
  transcribing medieval Portuguese texts, specifically forais (charters). It
  includes images of medieval manuscripts, along with corresponding line-level
  transcription labels, to facilitate the development of models capable of
  recognizing and transcribing historical handwriting.

  The dataset is ideal for OCR/HTR tasks and segmentation tasks within the
  domain of medieval document transcription. It serves as a critical resource
  for advancing automated transcription tools for medieval texts, making
  historical archives more accessible.
