 XML transcriptions and JPEG images exported from Transkribus as ground truth
 for an eScriptorium-Kraken HTR model (CER 11-12%) trained on the correspondence of Joseph
 Dalton Hooker (1817-1911), primarily letters to William Turner Thiselton-Dyer
 (1843-1928) during the late-19th/early-20th century. Many transcriptions in
 this dataset were generated by a small team of anonymous volunteers as part of
 the Joseph Hooker Correspondence Project based at Kew Gardens. All images in
 this dataset are reproduced with the kind permission of the Board of Trustees
 of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (© RBG, Kew). Contact archives@kew.org for
