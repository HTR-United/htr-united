  This dataset was created by a collaborative working group with the aim of
  transcribing

  medieval vernacular religious texts across a range of European languages. To
  reflect the

  linguistic expertise of the group members, the project included Old and Middle
  French, Old and Middle Irish, Old Castilian, Old Swedish, and Early New High
  German (Bavarian). Religious texts were chosen as a common thread because of
  their wide diffusion in the European vernacular tradition, their high survival
  rate in manuscripts, and their relevance for the study of medieval cultural
  and textual practices.


  The dataset is based on manuscripts preserved in France, Spain, Sweden,
  Germany, and Ireland, dating from the 11th to the 15th centuries, with a
  particular concentration in the 15th

  century. All manuscripts belong to the category of medium to highly decorated
  literary manuscripts. They are written in clearly identifiable scripts,
  predominantly in one or two columns; two manuscripts also include marginal
  texts.

  We followed the guidelines of CATMuS (1.6) :

  And used the SegmOnto controlled vocabulary :

  **Segmentation guidelines**


  **MainZone** : see SegmOnto. MainZone contains principle text, as a single
  block, without any paratext. If there are many columns, we made different
  blocks. Interlinear glosses are part of the MainZone.

  **NumberingZone** : see SegmOnto. Contains page numbers or folio numbers.

  **GraphicZone** : images or decorations.

  **MarginTextZone** : marginal glosses or additions.

  **DropCapitalZone** : see SegmOnto. Any type of capital letters, without any
  subtype. Do not transcribe it.

  **RunningTitleZone** : see SegmOnto. Zone containing a running title.


  **DefaultLine / default (Kraken Result)** : standard textline.

  **HeadingLine** : Any heading, without consideration for the level.

  **InterlinearLine** : Any line between standard baseline.


  Verse initials (appearing at the start of each line of a versified text,
  similar in size to the remaining text of the verse) should be included in the
  line of the corresponding verse. They should thus be segmented in the MainZone
  as normal text.
   
  Some initial letters (not illuminated), which hang slightly below the line are
  not included in the mask, meaning that they have to be later added to the
  transcription.
   
  **Transcription guidelines**

  We followed the CATMus guidelines when transcribing our documents. Given the
  diversity of our corpus, we chose a graphemic transcription system.
  Allographic variants (‘u/v’ and ‘i’/’j’) were normalised. When it comes to
  ‘z’/’s’, every allograph of ‘s’ was transcribed by ‘s’, and we made a
  difference between ‘s’ and ‘z’. We didn’t separate agglutinated words and
  verse initials were to be kept separated (using a space) from the rest of the
  word. When it comes to the choice of signs, we used four main signs: “.” for
  single dots, “:” for more than single dots, “/” for diastoles and signs that
  look like virgulas and “¶” for section markers. We didn’t normalize capital
  letters. We also transcribed hyphenations and diastoles. Also, if a character
  does not exist in MUFI but carries linguistic importance and is a common
  occurring character in a manuscript, a new character can be created by
  combining MUFI characters and symbols. Abbreviations were not developed and we
  transcribed them adhering to MUFI. In other words, we transcribe what we see,
  so that the dataset works for every vernacular language of our corpus. Every
  character is described in the CatMus guidelines:
