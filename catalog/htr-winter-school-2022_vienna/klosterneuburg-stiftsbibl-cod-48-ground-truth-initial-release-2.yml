description: >-
  This is ground truth for the vast collection of sermons of Nikolaus von
  Dinkelsbühl (ca. 1360 to 17th March 1433), translated and reorganised by a
  German redactor, from the 15th century has never been edited until now. It
  consists of 361 folios of parchment and paper. The text speaks about various
  topics such as fasting and other religious practices. Being one of the leading
  intellectuals of his time, Nikolaus von Dinkelsbühl also contributed to the
  development of the University of Vienna. The manuscript was probably produced
  in the vicinity of Klosterneuburg in Austria and is still kept there today
  (Shelfmark: Cod. 48).


  Data collection and ground truth creation:


  The edition at hand was produced by an international team of researchers from
  various fields in the context of the Vienna HTR Winter School 2022 with the
  help of Transkribus Expert Client.


  We uploaded the images of the manuscript into the Transkribus platform,
  applied the line recognition tool and manually copied the transcribed text
  lines into the recognised line boxes. Various models were trained with the
  ground truth (20% of the entire codex) created by the team.


  Images of the Klosterneuburg, Augustiner-Chorherrenstift, Cod. 48 are
