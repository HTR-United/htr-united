description: >-
  The HPGT dataset consists of images of Handwritten Paleographic 
  Greek Text, derived from the Bodleian Libraries' Greek manuscript 
  collection, specifically the Barocci collection, which dates from
  the 8th to the 17th centuries. This dataset is divided into two
  editions: HPGTR.N, which contains 77 unsegmented images categorized 
  by century from the 10th to the 16th, and HPGTR.S, which features 
  carefully segmented lines from selected images to facilitate machine 
  learning tasks. The dataset captures a range of characteristics, 
  including variations in writing style, page conditions, and 
  manuscript production details.

  This dataset is part of the following work: Paraskevi Platanou, 
  John Pavlopoulos, and Georgios Papaioannou. 2022. Handwritten 
  Paleographic Greek Text Recognition: A Century-Based Approach. 
  In *Proceedings of the "Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference"*,
