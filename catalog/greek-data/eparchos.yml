description: >-
  The dataset originates from a Greek handwritten codex that dates from around
  1500-1530. This is the subset of the codex British Museum Addit. 6791, written
  by two hands, one by Antonius Eparchos and the other by Camillos Zanettus (ff.
  104r-174v) and delivers texts by Hierocles (In Aureum carmen), Matthaeus
  Blastares (Collectio alphabetica) and, notably, texts by Michael Psellos (De
  omnifaria doctrina). The writing delivers the most important abbreviations,
  logograms and conjunctions, which are cited in virtually every Greek minuscule
  handwritten codex from the years of the manuscript transliteration and the
  prevalence of the minuscule script (9th century) to the post-Byzantine years.
  This dataset consists of 120 scanned handwritten text pages, containing 9285
  lines of text, 18809 words (6787 unique words). For each page, a PageXML is
  provided containing the following groundtruth:
  1. Text region polygon coordinates
  2. Text line polygon coordinates with the corresponding transcription text
  3. Word polygon coordinated with the corresponding transcription text
language:

  - Abbreviation and ligatures were resolved
  - Minuscule in the beginning of sentences were kept as such.
