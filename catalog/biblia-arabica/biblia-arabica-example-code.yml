transcription-guidelines: >-
  1. Only transcribe the lines that are Bible text, not headings, rubrics,
  marginalia, catchwords, etc.

  2. Everything should be typed exactly as it appears in the manuscript.

  3. Don't add any dots to the rasm that aren't in the manuscript.
      - E.g., if you see فال instead of قال or حعل instead of جعل, don't correct it.
      - Pay attention to ي vs. ى and ة vs. ه. Many manuscripts do not place dots above a ta marbuta.
      - For undotted initial/medial ب، ت، ث، ن، ي use the undotted ى (which you can get by pressing the shift key).
      - For undotted final ب، ت، or ث use the ٮ (you can copy it from here).
      - Final ن is always ن even if it is undotted in the manuscript.
      - For an undotted initial/medial ف/ق, which cannot be distinguished from each other, use ٯ ("dotless qaf" not waw, copy it from here).
  4. Do not transcribe any vowels at all, even if the manuscript has them.

  5. Do not transcribe any hamza diacritics (e.g. أ) or shadda even if the
  manuscript has them.
      - Except: Allah can be written as الله even if the manuscript doesn't have the diacritics.
  6. Pay careful attention not to add ء (hamza) as a consonant unless it is in
  the manuscript. Do not standardize spellings.

  7. Transcribe all dividers (dots, circles, crosses, etc.) with a simple period
  with spaces on each side ( . )
