transcription-guidelines: The transcription strictly follows what is written on the
  images, including accentuation or capitalization errors. The segmentation follows
  the SegmOnto ontology and mostly relies on MainZone and DefaultLine. Beware that
  this dataset barely contains any ponctuation and that most lines begin with a capital
  letter.
