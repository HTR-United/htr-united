  6000 ground truth of VOC and notarial deeds and 3.000.000 HTR of VOC, WIC and
  notarial deeds

  The National Archives of the Netherlands and Noord-Hollands Archief conducted
  a project using the Transkribus HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) platform.
  The aim was to semi automatically transcribe 2 million pages of old Dutch
  texts.


  The transcribed archives are 17th and 18th century documents from the Dutch
  East-Asia Company (VOC). And 19th century notarial deeds from Noord-Hollands
  Archief and other archives in the provinces.


  In order to train the HTR software a team produced transcriptions of
  approximately 6000 scans. The scans are randomly selected from the dataset and
  contain hundreds of hands. With these transcriptions a model is trained that
  can recognize more than 90% of the characters correctly. Transkribus
  transcribed the 2 million scans automatically using the trained model.


  Later on, 1 million extra scans concerning the West India Company (WIC) were
  transcribed automatically without adding extra ground truth or training. These
  archives are from the 17th and 18th century.


  The datasets published in Zenodo contain the ground truth (scans in JPG,
  transcription in PAGE XML) and the HTR results (in PAGE XML and TXT). See the
  overview on the Zenodo page.


  A specification on which archives have been transcribed (both GT and HTR) can
  be found on the Zenodo.

  Disclaimer: due to a variety of languages used and the bad state of the
  documents the HTR results of "1.05.21, Dutch series Guyana" can be of poor
  quality.
