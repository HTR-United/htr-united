description: >-
  This dataset contains 165,673 image and corresponding text line files (.png
  for images and .txt for the texts) in a random 80/10/10 training, validation
  and test set split. The source is the extensive correspondence of Swiss
  reformer Heinrich Bullinger (1504-1575) and his over 800 different
  correspondents. It therefore contains great variety in handwriting styles.
  Furthermore, it is multilingual since there are Latin and Early New High
  German (and sometimes mixed) letters. The data is split into Latin and Early
  New High German (determined with langid) and put into separate folders (de for
  Early New High German and la for Latin).
