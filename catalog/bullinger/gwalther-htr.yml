description: >
  This is ground truth for Rudolph Gwalther’s (1519-1586) handwriting taken from his book "Lateinische" Gedichte", where he accumulated writings between 1540 and 1580.
  Data collection and ground truth creation:  
  At the time we collected the data, we found 150 images with corresponding transcriptions by Peter Stotz on e-manuscripta (reference: Gwalther, Rudolf: Lateinische Gedichte. Zürich, 1540-1580. Zentralbibliothek Zürich, Ms D 152, https://doi.org/10.7891/e-manuscripta-26750 / Public Domain Mark) . We removed 8 images with too many corrections or vertical texts. Next, we uploaded the images into the Transkribus platform, applied the line recognition tool and manually copied the transcribed text lines into the recognised line boxes. During this process, we made some corrections, which were mainly due to inconsistencies in punctuation and capitalised letters.
