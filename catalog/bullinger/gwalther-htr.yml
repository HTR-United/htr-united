description: "This is ground truth for Rudolph Gwalther\u2019s (1519-1586) handwriting\
  \ taken from his book \"Lateinische\" Gedichte\", where he accumulated writings\
  \ between 1540 and 1580. Data collection and ground truth creation:   At the time\
  \ we collected the data, we found 150 images with corresponding transcriptions by\
  \ Peter Stotz on e-manuscripta (reference: Gwalther, Rudolf: Lateinische Gedichte.\
  \ Z\xFCrich, 1540-1580. Zentralbibliothek Z\xFCrich, Ms D 152, https://doi.org/10.7891/e-manuscripta-26750\
  \ / Public Domain Mark) . We removed 8 images with too many corrections or vertical\
  \ texts. Next, we uploaded the images into the Transkribus platform, applied the\
  \ line recognition tool and manually copied the transcribed text lines into the\
  \ recognised line boxes. During this process, we made some corrections, which were\
  \ mainly due to inconsistencies in punctuation and capitalised letters.\n"
