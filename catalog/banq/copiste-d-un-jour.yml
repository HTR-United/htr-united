description: >-
  This project draws inspiration from the CREMMA WIKIPEDA data set, with the
  objective to create a ground truth repository of contemporary Québécois
  handwriting to train HTR models. It is based on a collection of randomly
  selected Wikipedia summaries. Each text comprises between 125 and 175 words
  and was copied by hand by volunteers. The texts were ordered in a way to
  prioritize texts that presented rare character 1- and 2-grams. Non-French
  characters were replaced with "-". In general, the copy of one text took
  between 1 and 2 pages. In total, 267 volunteers copied 265 texts (2 texts were
  unfortunately copied twice by two different volunteers). We took care of the
  alignment between the handwritten portion and the original text.
