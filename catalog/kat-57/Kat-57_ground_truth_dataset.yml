 Background


 Catalogue -1957 is an alphabetic library catalogue listing Lund University
 Libraryâ€™s holdings up to 1957. A project has been ongoing to scan and
 transcribe the catalogue cards.


 About 10.000 cards were manually transcribed to create a ground truth dataset.


 From 2178 card drawers, one drawer for every letter in the alphabet was
 selected to transcribe, except for in the letter S, where two drawers were
 selected.


 The writing on the catalogue cards is a mix of typewriter and handwriting.
 There are more than 10 different hands.


 The cards were transcribed by a small team at the University Library.


 Dataset


 The set consists of PNG images with corresponding PAGE XML files. The
 transcriptions were made in eScriptorium.
