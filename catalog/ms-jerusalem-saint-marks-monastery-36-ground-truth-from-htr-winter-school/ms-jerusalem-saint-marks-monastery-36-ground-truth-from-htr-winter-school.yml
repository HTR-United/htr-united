transcription-guidelines: >-
  The segmentation of the folios followed the SegmOnto vocabulary for annotation
  of regions:


  - MainZone: the main column of text.

  - MarginTextZone: any marginal words or phrases, including catchwords. Also
  used for interlinear glosses.

  - NumberingZone: any page or folio numbers.


  The transcription guidelines included spaces, the Syriac letters, some
  diacritics, punctuation, and no vowel dots or markings.


  - Allowed diacritics:
    - Syome
    - Dots over feminine suffix heh
    - Dots in pronouns: above for demonstrative, below for personal
    - Dots in verbs: to distinguish participles and perfects
    - Dots to distinguish homographs
  - Excluded diacritics:
    - Vowel dots
    - Dots of hardening and softening (qushoyo and rukokho)

  Punctuation marks were not normalized, but rather transcribed as they appear
  in the manuscript (. ܆ ܇ : ܀).
