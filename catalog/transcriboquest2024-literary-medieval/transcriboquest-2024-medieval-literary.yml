  This dataset was created in the context of TranscriboQuest 2024 (Medieval
  Literary Team) held in Lyon (11/09/2024-13/09/2024). We opted to focus on
  medieval scientific documents that are damaged, in several different
  languages. The result is 808 lines transcribed by experts in the field. The
  dataset contains the images of the manuscripts and ALTO-XMLs.
