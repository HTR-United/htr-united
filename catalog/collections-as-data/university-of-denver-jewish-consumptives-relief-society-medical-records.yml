  Training and validation set. Transcribed records available upon request.

  The transcribed corpus of records from the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society
  contains data that include individually identifiable health information, among
  other sensitive information regarding persons and people.


  All individuals for whom records are provided have been deceased for at least
  70 years, but were they still living today, these records would be recognized
  as being protected health information under the US Health Insurance
  Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).


  While HIPPA and other privacy laws no longer apply to these individuals, in
  providing these data the University of Denver wishes to foster research
  practices that express the utmost respect for the human beings whose lives are
  represented, at least in some part, in these collections. In addition, we ask
  researchers respect the lives of these individuals’ ancestors and their
  communities.


  To foster practices that honor patients, staff, nurses and physicians
  connected with the JCRS Sanitorium, as well as their families, ancestors and
  communities, we ask that researchers disclose their intended use of the
  collection for review by our Advisory Board (see reverse). This Board is
  comprised of ethicists, historians, librarians, attorneys, physicians, and
  members of the Jewish community.


  In addition, we ask researchers agree to conduct their work under the
  following set of principles:


  1. I affirm the role of JCRS patients and staff as data creators and will
  avoid exploiting and/or dehumanizing them by treating them simply as data.

  2. My research will, when possible and appropriate, account for the contexts
  surrounding the JCRS subjects as data arise. My work will recognize that all
  data and datasets are shaped by decisions about how histories are recorded,
  remembered, and valued.

  3. If the nature of my work is such that I am sharing the life stories and/or
  narratives of individuals in these data, and I can do so with no potential
  harm to their reputation or that of their ancestors, I will honor them by
  naming them. If the nature of my work is such that I am exploring large-scale
  patterns in the dataset, and naming individuals serves no specific research
  purpose, I will anonymize and/or redact names within the data. 

  4. If I am publishing the results of research conducted with these data, I
  will, if possible and appropriate, include a note of recognition and/or
  gratitude in my publication. We suggest a version of: “This work was made
  possible in part by the patients, staff, nurses, physicians, and community of
  the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society (JCRS). The people who lived, worked,
  and died at the JCRS sought to relieve human suffering. I am grateful to
  them.”
