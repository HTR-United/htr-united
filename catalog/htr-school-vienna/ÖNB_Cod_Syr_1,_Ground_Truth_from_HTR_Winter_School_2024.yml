 Ground truth of 140 folios of ÖNB Cod. Syr. 1. This ground truth was produced
 by participants of the Vienna 2024 HTR Winter School, who used Transkribus to
 manually correct a preliminary automatic transcription that had been generated
 using Kraken/eScriptorium.

 The segmentation of the folios followed the SegmOnto vocabulary for annotation
 of regions:


 - MainZone: the main column of text.

 - MainZone-gold: any sections of the main column where the text is written in
 gold block characters, as in the start of the text here. (The - character is a
 substitution for SegmOnto's recommended : character for declaring subtypes,
 since Transkribus did not allow for use of the colon character in the region
 name.)

 - MarginTextZone: any marginal words or phrases, including catchwords. Also
 used for interlinear glosses.

 - NumberingZone: any page or folio numbers.


 The transcription includes spaces, the Syriac letters, some diacritics,
 punctuation, and no vowel dots or markings.


 - Allowed diacritics:
  - Syome
  - Dots over feminine suffix heh
  - Dots in pronouns: above for demonstrative, below for personal
  - Dots in verbs: to distinguish participles and perfects
  - Dots to distinguish homographs
 - Excluded diacritics:
  - Vowel dots
  - Dots of hardening and softening (qushoyo and rukokho)

 Punctuation marks were not normalized, but rather transcribed as they appear
 in the manuscript (. ܆ ܇ : ܀).


 Transkribus's unclear tag was used when readings were uncertain or the text
 was damaged or unclear.
