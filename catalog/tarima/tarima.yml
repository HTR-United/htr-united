  The dataset has been collated within the frame of the TariMa project (Tarih
  al-Maghrib. Writing History in the Maghreb in the modern and contemporary
  era), sponsored by the French agency Collex-Persee and led by Antoine
  Perrier (CNRS). It comprises different image resolution and size (width from
  982px to 8049px), different layouts (double page, multiple columns), and state
  of conservation. It also mixes microfilms, scans and lithographies. It
  presents a very wide variety representative of the Maghrebi Arabic production.
