description: >-
 In a project of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, we completely transcribed two
 manuscripts (Ms. germ. oct. 842, Ms. germ. fol. 1045) related to the
 Augustinian canonesses in Inzigkofen, dating from the 15th century and
 containing German texts. They were written by three scribes in three different
 Gothic scripts.

 The transcriptions are mainly graphematic, reproducing the scribes' usage of
 long s/round s, i/j, u/v, and superscripts. All abbreviations were kept, using
 a relatively small set of special characters.
