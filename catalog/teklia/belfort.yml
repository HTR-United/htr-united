  This dataset includes minutes of Belfort municipal council drawn up between
  1790 and 1946. Documents include deliberations, lists of councillors,
  convocations, and agendas. The dataset includes 24,105 text-line images that
  were automatically detected from pages. 

  Up to four transcriptions are available for each line image: 

  * two from human annotators (in `Transcriptions/callico_1/` and
  `Transcriptions/callico_2/`)

  * two from automatic models (in `Transcriptions/dan/` and
  `Transcriptions/pylaia/`)
