  This dataset was created in order to produce an HTR model for the Digital
  Peraire project. The documents are handwritten, dating from the second half of
  the 20th century, written by Lucien Péraire in French with a blue ink pen or,
  more frequently, with a blue pencil.

transcription-guidelines: >-
  The transcription respects what is written on the document, including
  ponctuation and spelling errors. The case is respected: capital letters are
  transcribed with capital letters. Crossed out words are signaled by # which
  isn't used to transcribe anything else. The SegmOnto ontology was used for the
  segmentation of this dataset. For regions, MainZone and MarginTextZone were
  used. For lines, DefaultLine and InterlinearLine were used. The original
  documents are held at the Bibliothèque Sébert, Espéranto-France, Paris. They
  should be mentionned every time the images are used.
